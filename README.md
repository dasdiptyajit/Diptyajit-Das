I am a doctoral candidate currently pursuing my PhD in Systems Neuroscience at Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg. Proficient in multi-modal neuroimaging techniques, including EEG, MEG, and fMRI, my research centers on understanding the origin and role of the P300 brain marker. 

## My Proficiencies Encompass:

- Experimental design and multi-dimensional data analysis.
- Open-source software and hardware development.
- Inverse modeling and brain network mapping.
- Simulation modeling of cortical dipoles to predict source-sensor patterns.
